Who would’ve thought years later I’d hold this ticket, and wishing I had one more shot to say hello (or goodbye) to my old man. As a kid, we were always on the road and I don’t remember my dad smiling much, as he was always mentally tired and his body banged up and in pain from the nightly grind - but he did find moments of PEACE when he was wrestling in that squared circle. Even in this video you see my dad attempting a SLIGHT SMILE 🙂I know I’m not easy to buy gifts for, so VERY thoughtful gifts like this mean the world to me from my loved ones. Mahalo brother Brad. And my sistas Maya & Mere too. ❤️🥃@jonbrandoncruz 🎞️ 🥃",

And looking back to when I was a kid - my dad, Rocky Johnson was actually one of Make-A-Wish’s VERY FIRST WISH GRANTERS back in the 80’s. My dad was a very tough, no BS guy who wasn’t big on emotions. But when I saw him take this little boy, Bobby out of his wheelchair and hold him in his arms - I’d never seen my dad so loving, warm, caring and ATTENTIVE in my life. As a kid I remember thinking how surprised I was seeing my dad that warm and how cool it was to me, that my dad was a hero. But now as a man, I look back and think that the REAL HERO is that little boy Bobby, and my dad was LUCKY to have the honor of making little Bobby’s wish come true. I don’t have a ton of memories of my dad being so loving like this so it means a lot to me to relive this and this also reminds me of the power of MAKE A WISH. Thanks everyone for supporting @makeawishamerica, as I will always hold the foundation and ALL THE KIDS very close to my heart — I’ll leave you with one of my favorite quotes /It’s nice to be important, but it’s more important to be nice.

They were shooting 4hrs of TV tapings for the entire month. My dad wrestled over 325 nights a year. All the wrestlers did. That’s the way pro wrestling was back then — my dad was never home, always banged up and always in pain. Pro wrestlers were a different breed back then. Different cloth and DNA. Boundless love and respect to all the OG wrestlers, and “the wrestling way” of this crazy world that I love. I’m super hard (pain in the ass 😂🙋🏽‍♂️) to buy gifts for so it means so much to me to receive gifts like this where A LOT of thought and care is put into it. Appreciate the hell outta my guy, Brad Slater for this one. Awesome gift 🥃 #ProWrestlingHistory Who remembers Friendly’s ice cream 🍨!!??",

My wife’s father, Sib Hashian passed away in 2017 (you guys may remember him as the drummer from the rock band Boston 🥁) and since then he always “visits” her and her siblings in many forms, letting them know that he’s always here for them. It’s beautiful to see and their connection with their dad - even in the afterlife - always moves me. A few days ago, she asked me, “Does your dad ever visit you?” I said “No, I don’t think so. Maybe it’s because our relationship was too complicated and distraught when he died.” She said “Maybe you should just invite him to visit you. I have a feeling he doesn’t know what to do and he’s waiting.” So I did. Then the NEXT DAY this post popped up in my feed of my dad. He’s waving 👋🏾 and smiling away. He wasn’t a big smiler, but man he looks so happy and at peace here which makes my heart sing 🥹Having unresolved conflict with loved ones who then suddenly pass away, can be brutal. A real punch in the gut. But I think my dad’s spirit just needs some closure and to know “you and I are good dad and everything is gonna be alright.” Come visit anytime. @wrestleuncut 🙏🏾@jayglazer 🫱🏾‍🫲🏼",

      "postText": "Super grateful to co-author my next project (a non-fiction book) with award winning investigative journalist, @NickBilton. Nick and I have worked on this for months now, with many more months of work ahead of us - this has already been such an unbelievable, inspiring and eye opening experience. “The nonfiction book will chronicle the untold true story of a fierce and defiant Hawaiian crime syndicate known as The Company that battled outsider gangs and corporate invaders during the 1960s and 1970s. And it will shine a spotlight on its charismatic, powerful and strategic leader, Wilford “Nappy” Pulawa — the first and only Hawaiian mob boss in history.” My formative years were spent growing up in Honolulu, Hawai’i and this story is very personal - the more exhaustive research we do and people we speak to - the more I shake my head at how wildly and profoundly connected we all were. And still are. Mahalo to our director, Marty Scorsese for working so closely with us creatively as we all explore and embrace this Hawai’i story with mana and respect. More to come. Mahalo everyone 🥃#TheCompany #CrownePublishing",
