      "postText": "The announcement you’ve been waiting for! My May #MonthlyRead is…“Still Born by Guadalupe Nettel, translated by Rosalind Harvey. Laura and Alina are friends in their early 30s living in Mexico City. Both are determinedly childfree, believing that motherhood is a trap of the patriarchy. Then, Alina changes her mind. You might think this is where their lives diverge, but the turning point in this book is a surprise for everyone.As Alina’s life is upended with a devastating medical diagnosis for her unborn daughter, Alina and Laura’s friendship becomes more vital than ever.Baby Inés doesn’t die as her parents feared – she is still born, despite her prognosis. However, this story doesn’t shy away from the complex realities of raising a child with profound disabilities – instead, it focuses on the transcendent power of love, as the parents get to know their daughter. The experience is transformative for all the caregivers in Inés’ life. Care, in its many forms, is beautifully explored in this book – whether it’s Laura stepping in without fuss to care for the traumatised child living next door, or the pigeons on the balcony tenderly raising a cuckoo in their nest. And as you’ll learn, no one gets anything past a pigeon!This book is both uplifting and gut-wrenching, often at the same time. If you are dealing with any of the issues tackled in the book, please explore this story at your own pace. At its heart, it is a story about the many different ways to be a family, and it made me reflect on what an honour it is to care for someone you truly love.”- Dua x#service95bookclub",
