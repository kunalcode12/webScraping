It reminded me why I fell in love with collecting in the first place. This hobby brings people together. Kids, parents, lifelong fans, all connecting over shared memories, favorite players, and the stories behind the cards.There’s something powerful about walking into a space where generations can bond over their favorite teams, where a kid’s first pack might spark a lifelong passion, and where the history of sports comes alive in your hands. That’s what we’re building with CardVault, not just stores, but homes for the hobby and the spaces around it.Huge thank you to the entire CardVault team, our incredible partners, the passionate collectors, and the East Hampton community for welcoming us with open arms. You made it a day we’ll never forget. Grateful to be a part of this movement, and even more excited for what’s ahead.",

Reflecting on last year and thinking about the year ahead, there’s no better perspective than looking at these three and always trying to be better for them each day, and helping to guide them in whatever way possible. I’m so grateful for the experiences, blessings, family, friends, and everyone else who has impacted me along the way… I’m so blessed to have joy and gratitude in my life. No year ever goes exactly the way we want, but when I think about 2024, I could not have imagined anything better. So many new experiences that I got to share with amazing people, especially the three beautiful angels in these photos. I wish you all a happy healthy 2025, and as I tell so many of my loved ones, “the best is yet to come!”❤️❤️❤️",

When I was a kid in San Mateo, I’d spend hours at my local card shop, what’s on second, flipping through cards, trading with friends, and falling in love with the hobby. That joy shaped so much of my love for sports. And seeing so many fans and friends last night brought so much happiness to what already is a very exciting time. Thank you to everyone who works so hard the past six weeks to make this happen and over the past many years to bring card vault by Tom Brady to life. We have a great team, and we’re just getting started.With CardVault, our goal is to bring that same excitement to a new generation of collectors— making card collecting fun, accessible, and something kids (and kids at heart) can share together. More locations, across the country and across the world, are coming soon. PS: I’m still recovering from seeing all those cheering Giants and Jets fans, usually someone is trying to kill me, or something terrible happens when I’m around you guys 😂😂😂",
