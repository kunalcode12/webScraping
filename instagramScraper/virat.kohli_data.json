With its unique Beardsense Technology, it scans my beard 125 times per second and adapts to it. That’s not just precision—it’s like having 125 barbers at work. After all, Philips aur baaki trimmers mein 19 – 20 ka nahi, 125 ka farak hai!#PhilipsAllInOne #Trimmer #Philips #125KaFarak",

I know how much all this took from you. After every Test series, you came back a little wiser, a little humbler — and watching you evolve through it all has been a privilege.Somehow, I always imagined you’d retire international cricket in whites — But you’ve always followed your heart, and so I just want to say my love, you’ve earned every bit of this goodbye ❤️",

It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life.There’s something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.As I step away from this format, it’s not easy — but it feels right. I’ve given it everything I had, and it’s given me back so much more than I could’ve hoped for.I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way.I’ll always look back at my Test career with a smile.#269, signing off.🇮🇳❤️",
