The boiling point of dichloromethane is slightly below body temperature such that heat from from a finger and thumb will increase pressure in the bottom bulb which then pushes the purple (dyed) liquid through the thin glass pipe to the top. Heating the top bulb will hasten the return of the liquid to the bottom. Such glass devices demonstrate a reversible liquid-gas phase transition and were made famous by Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the first to describe the physics of their operation. Hence these are sometimes referred to as a ‚ÄúBouillant de Franklin‚Äù. ‚û°Ô∏è Follow the link in my profile for info on where to get similar glass boilers and other amazing items featured here on @physicsfun #thermodynamics #phase #physics #physicstoy #phasetransition #physicsfun #phasechange #heat #handboiler #dichloromethane #idealgas #PV=nRT #science #scienceisawesome",

Diamagnetic substances only have magnetic fields of their own when placed in an external magnetic field from another source- here the cube shaped magnet supplies the field. Diamagnetic fields are pretty weak though so a cylindrical neodymium magnet hangs above the figure and is adjusted to help lift the cube magnet against gravity. Trapped in equilibrium by these magnetic fields, the slightest air currents can send the cube magnet dancing. Although alchemists never succeeded in transmuting lead to gold, in 1981 physicists used the particle accelerator at Berkeley to shoot Carbon nuclei at thin foils of Bismuth- the resulting collisions did produced a tiny amount of Gold atoms! So modern nuclear physics, applied to the element Bismuth, finally accomplished the aspirations of the alchemists. üåüAnother amazing creation by Ernie McElhannon. ‚û°Ô∏è Follow the link in my profile for info on where to get this sculpture and other amazing items featured here on @physicsfun #diamagnetism #physics #physicstoy #neodymium #physicsfun #magneticfield #magnetism #levitation #maglev #science #bismuth #alchemy #alchemist #LBNL #GlennSeaborg #pyrolyticgraphite #scienceisawesome",

An interesting aspect of this piece is that the acrylic was filled with electrons in two separate regions, resulting in this two layer pattern when the acrylic was discharged to ground with a flash and bang. Electrons typically will not flow through an insulator such as acrylic, but a high velocity beam of them from a linear accelerator (an expensive and complex apparatus) allows the electrons to tunnel deep into the plastic and build up a very large charge slowly. Such a large charge can then create a high enough voltage to create a breakdown arc which is hot enough to leave the fractal pattern. This sculpture comes with an LED base which illuminates the fractal with morphing colors. ‚û°Ô∏è Follow the link in my profile for info on where to get fractal sculptures like this and other amazing items featured here on @physicsfun #Litchenberg #frozenlightning #fractal #electron #linearaccelerator #beamtree #physics #physicstoy #lamp #lavalamp #electromagnetism #science #lightning #highvoltage #scienceisawesome #electricity #arc #electricarc #fractalart #fractalsculpture",

Selenite fibers are also very clear and will act as a natural form of fiber optic transmission- the sphere looks transparent when the camera lens peers down the fiber bundle direction. ‚û°Ô∏è Follow the link in my profile for info on where to get a polished selenite sphere and many other amazing items featured here on @physicsfun #physics #mineral #gemstone #iridescence #refraction  #selenite #chatoyancy #chatoyancyeffect #satinspar #fiberoptic #rockhound #luster #optics #amazing #mineralogy #geology #geophysicstoy #scienceisawesome",

Here a small neodymium magnet is made to  float between two 99% pure bismuth 10mm cubes which are held in precise configuration by friction with the parallel walls of the acrylic assembly I made. Diamagnetic substances only have magnetic fields of their own when placed in an external magnetic field from another source- here the tiny cube magnet supplies the field. Diamagnetic fields are pretty weak though so a powerful cylindrical neodymium magnet sits above the cubes and is adjusted to help lift the tiny cube magnet against gravity. *except for a special form of carbon known as pyrolytic graphite. ‚û°Ô∏è Follow the link in my profile for info on where to get these pure bismuth cubes and other amazing items featured here on @physicsfun #diamagnetism #physics #physicsfun #physicstoy #neodymium #magneticfield #magnetism #levitation #maglev #science #bismuth #eclipse #equilibrium #pyrolyticgraphite #scienceisawesome",

Red indicates the north pole and blue the south pole of the Magnaprobe dipole- the red end is attracted to any other magnet‚Äôs south pole like a 3D compass. Magnetic viewing film reveals a cross section of the magnetic field where colors correspond to intensity, but can‚Äôt show the direction of the field like the magnaprobe device can. Together these devices give us insights about the existence of magnetic fields that our five senses cannot detect. ‚û°Ô∏è Follow the link in my profile for info on where to get this and many other items featured here on @physicsfun #magnaprobe #physics #physicstoy #magnets #magneticfield #magneticforce #electromagnetism #neodymium #dipole #science #scienceisawesome",

It takes almost two full minutes for the ball to move to the bottom and 5 minutes for the air bubble come to rest at the top- shown here at 5X speed. Note the strange phenomena that occurs when the ball bearing passes by the bubble.
