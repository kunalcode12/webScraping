And as a result, news readers often find themselves blocked by paywalls from reading important stories about government business.\"That experience is particularly frustrating for readers who are unable to access the groundbreaking investigative reports outlets like Wired magazine have been publishing, particularly over the first couple months of the Trump administration,\" the Freedom of the Press Foundation release reads. \"Fortunately, Wired has a solution — it’s going to stop paywalling articles that are primarily based on public records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.\"Access to journalism based on public records is more important than ever at this moment, with government websites and records disappearing, DOGE doing its best to operate outside the public’s view, and the National Archive in disarray.We’re excited to be the first publication to partner with @freedomofthepressfoundation to offer this for our new coverage.

But Trump Media and Technology Group appears to have since changed its tune.In a press release on Tuesday, TMTG confirmed that it has agreed to sell $1.5 billion worth of equity and take on a further $1 billion in debt—and plans to use the proceeds to add vast quantities of bitcoin to its balance sheet.The deal puts TMTG in competition with a growing stable of bitcoin accumulation stocks, which act as a substitute of sorts for investing in bitcoin, without investors having to handle crypto themselves. In theory, as the price of bitcoin rises and falls, so should the stock price of the companies with large bitcoin treasuries.TMTG’s embrace of crypto represents a small part of a more elaborate picture: Within the past year, Trump and his family have forged into almost every segment of the crypto market, despite a chorus of complaints relating to alleged abuses of office and conflicts of interest.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full story.",

Courts are trying to strike down some of DOGE’s most egregious efforts. It may seem as though the worst excesses of DOGE have passed, replaced by something closer to a stasis.This isn’t true. Not even close.While the image of DOGE most likely burned into your retina is that of Elon Musk wielding a literal chain saw, the theatrics belie an organization that has quietly permeated all corners of the federal government. More than that, it’s increasingly clear that its objectives are now indistinguishable from that of the broader Trump administration. Removing DOGE at this point would be like trying to remove a drop of food coloring from a glass of water.Even if Musk claims he’s stepping away—though he met with House Republicans just this week—his lieutenants are still firmly in place at the agencies that control the federal workforce and regulate his companies. Meanwhile, the victories against DOGE may be short-lived. The Trump administration used it as a battering ram to push its policies through with overwhelming force. While the courts have held firm in some cases, the policies still exist, and there are other ways to achieve them. The Wall Street Journal reported recently that director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought would pick up DOGE’s cost-cutting mantle in the post-Musk era. Expect him to wield not a hammer but a finely edged blade.This has always been the plan. Vought is the architect of Project 2025, the policy road map that DOGE has been following turn by turn. He has been explaining for months what happens after DOGE’s first assault.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the rest of this  #WIREDPoliticsLab newsletter from Executive Editor of News, Brian Barrett.",

Rather than splitting men and women into different categories, athletes will be categorized based on their chromosomes: There will be an XX and an XY category for each event.There will be up to $500,000 in prize money on offer for each event, with $250,000 for the winner, and a bonus of $1,000,000 for anyone who breaks the 100m sprint or the 50m freestyle world record. (Other world record breakers will get a bonus of $250,000.) At a glitzy press conference announcing the details of the first event, organizers also revealed that the Games had helped an “enhanced athlete” break two long-standing 50m freestyle world records in swimming.Kristian Gkolomeev, a 31-year-old Greek-Bulgarian swimmer who came fifth in the 50m freestyle at the Olympic Games in Paris, started his enhancement program in early February. Toward the end of that month, at a pool in Greensboro, North Carolina, he broke César Cielo’s 50-meter freestyle world record of 20.91 seconds, which had stood for 16 years. Gkolomeev swam 0.02 seconds faster. In April, he broke Caeleb Dressel’s 2019 so-called textile world record—done without wearing a speed suit—of 21.04 seconds. He swam 0.01 seconds faster.“This isn’t just about breaking records,” said Gkolomeev in a press release. “It’s about breaking limits. The Enhanced Games gave me the resources and the team to unlock a new level of performance—and now the whole world can see what’s possible.”Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full article.",

This database, however, didn’t include any clues about who owns the data or where it may have been gathered from.The sheer range and massive scope of the login details, which include accounts connected to a large array of digital services, indicate that the data is some sort of compilation, possibly kept by researchers investigating a data breach or other cybercriminal activity or owned directly by attackers and stolen by infostealer malware.“This is probably one of the weirdest ones I’ve found in many years,” Fowler says. “As far as the risk factor here, this is way bigger than most of the stuff I find, because this is direct access into individual accounts.

The explosion caused extensive damage, but all embryos inside the clinic were saved. FBI officials called it a targeted act of terrorism, noting that Bartkus attempted to livestream the attack.Terrorism experts say Bartkus was linked to antinatalism—the belief that life is inherently suffering and should not be perpetuated—as well as promortalism and misandry. His online presence included writings and recordings that described these beliefs. According to Katherine Keneally, U.S. director of threat analysis at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), Bartkus’ ideology went beyond nihilism. He appeared to believe he had a mission to prevent new life from being created, which may have motivated his choice to target a fertility clinic.While antinatalism and nihilism have occasionally surfaced in extremist circles, Keneally said promortalism has not previously been a primary motivator in violent acts. ISD analysts believe Bartkus may represent a new and dangerous escalation.The bombing came just over a week after ISD released a report warning that nihilistic ideologies are fueling a wave of violence in the U.S. and Europe. The report highlighted two online subcultures in particular: the True Crime Community, which glamorizes mass shooters, and No Lives Matter, a group that seeks to replicate violent attacks and spread extremist content through memes, music, and other media. No Lives Matter also intersects with Satanic imagery and is linked to the 764 network, which has exploited minors online.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read more.",

The nonprofit is able to seek damages because it owns shares of Paramount. It plans to act on behalf of itself and other shareholders, alleging that the settlement would amount to the company’s executives “breaching their fiduciary duties and wasting corporate assets by engaging in conduct that US senators and others believe could amount to unlawful bribery that falls outside the scope of the business judgment rule.” The White House and Paramount did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read more.",

To the beat of “Y.M.C.A” by The Village People, Trump shimmied, gyrated, and pumped his arms above his head.Looking on were more than 200 people who had been invited to the Trump National Golf Club for a private gala dinner. They had won their seats by purchasing large quantities of Trump’s own crypto coin—TRUMP—some holding millions of dollars’ worth.On the menu for the evening was pan seared halibut with a citrus reduction, a filet mignon with demi glaze—and, the attendees hoped, a chance to speak to the US president. The four largest coin holders—along with two other attendees selected by raffle, sources say—received a gem-encrusted Trump gold watch. But Trump didn’t even stick around to give them away, departing immediately after his speech in a golf cart. Four of the guests agreed to tell WIRED about their experience.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read more.",

That demand from AI, the research states, could double by the end of this year, comprising nearly half of all total data-center electricity consumption worldwide, excluding the electricity used for bitcoin mining.The new research is published in a commentary by Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company that evaluates the environmental impact of technology. De Vries-Gao started Digiconomist in the late 2010s to explore the impact of bitcoin mining, another extremely energy-intensive activity, would have on the environment. Looking at AI, he says, has grown more urgent over the past few years because of the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and other large language models that use massive amounts of energy. According to his research, worldwide AI energy demand is now set to surpass demand from bitcoin mining by the end of this year.But there’s still a lot of unknowns about the share that AI, specifically, takes up in that current configuration of electricity use by data centers. Data centers power a variety of services—like hosting cloud services and providing online infrastructure—that aren’t necessarily linked to the energy-intensive activities of AI. Tech companies, meanwhile, largely keep the energy expenditure of their software and hardware private.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full story.",

As the world turns more and more toward operations that need precise coordinate systems like the ones NGS provides, the science that underpins this office’s activities, these experts say, is becoming even more crucial.NGS was formed in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson, the son of a surveyor and cartographer. Originally called the Survey of the Coast, the organization, led by a young Swiss immigrant named Ferdinand Hassler, was tasked with mapping the coastlines of the new country. Over the next 200 years, its mission expanded to cover the practice of geodesy: the science of calculating the shape of the Earth, its orientation in space, and its gravitational field.NGS is currently responsible for maintaining and updating what’s known as the National Spatial Reference System, a consistent system of physical coordinates used across federal and local governments, the private sector, and academia. This includes not only latitude and longitude, but also measurements of depth and height as well as calculations around Earth’s gravitational field—crucial mathematics that inform much of the basic infrastructure around us, from constructing bridges to mapping out water and electric lines. NGS also maintains and operates more than 1,700 federally owned satellite receivers across the US, which provide publicly available geospatial information.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full story.",

Though not named, his voice may be familiar to video game fans as that of Mark Brown. The trouble is, Brown had nothing to do with the video.Brown, who goes by Game Maker’s Toolkit, is a content creator and developer who’s covered video game design for over a decade. His channel has 220 videos, broadcast to over 1.65 million subscribers, where he gives in-depth explanations on things like puzzle mechanics in Blue Prince or addresses UI problems in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. (Brown has also previously written for WIRED UK.)The Doom video, posted to a channel called Game Offline Lore, is not Brown’s typical content. But the problem is actually bigger than that: Brown never actually narrated this video. Instead, he says, the creator of Game Offline Lore has used an AI version of his voice without his knowledge or consent.Brown filed a privacy complaint to YouTube, which typically gives the offender 48 hours to remove their video before YouTube officially gets involved. Typically, he says, YouTube “has pretty robust systems” and tools to get these videos taken down. But Brown says it’s been over 48 hours now since he reached out. Both videos remain live. Their creator, he says, has been removing comments where people say they’ve stolen Brown’s voice.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full story.",

      "postText": "As “SkinnyTok” posts advise people to suck up their hunger, some creators are using blunt humor to dissuade young people from pro-eating disorder messaging.“SkinnyTok” is a genre of videos about weight loss, ranging from “harsh motivation” to food diaries showing what women eat to stay “lean.” It has been compared to “pro-anorexia” and “pro-eating disorder” communities that have thrived for over a decade on platforms like Tumblr. More recently, on X, pro-eating disorder groups have attracted hundreds of thousands of members through algorithmic recommendation.The groups proliferated after Elon Musk bought the platform in 2022, and users say they have flourished due to lack of moderation. TikTok says it has cracked down on these types of posts, saying pro-eating disorder content is banned on its platform and that it has taken other steps to mitigate the issue. But experts tell WIRED that both social media and the widespread nature of GLP-1 weight loss drugs (which are often advertised on the platforms) can be triggering, not only to people who are in recovery from eating disorders, but to people who have never struggled with them before.Now, some creators are releasing videos that poke fun at the absurdity of eating disorder content in an effort to dissuade others from buying into it. But experts say it’s a fine line between using humor to debunk and punching down.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full article.",

But CEO Jay Graber says the app is for everyone—and could revolutionize how people communicate online.Graber isn’t your typical tech CEO. While Zuckerberg leaned into digital monarchy, she wore a shirt that read: “A World Without Kings.” She’s not just rebelling. She’s rebuilding.Bluesky started as a skunkworks inside Twitter. Now it’s a fully independent, decentralized social platform with 34.6M users—and growing fast. Its core? The AT Protocol, an open-source infrastructure where users and apps coexist, evolve, and collaborate.Think of it like this:• Twitter + Reddit vibes.• Custom, community-run feeds.• Plug-and-play moderation rules.• Interoperable apps built on one shared backend.Bluesky isn’t about building the next Twitter. It’s about building a new internet layer where identity, content, and community are portable and sovereign. A web where anyone can self-host, moderate, and monetize—on their own terms.As Jay Graber puts it: “This is a choose-your-own-adventure game.”Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full interview.",

      "postText": "US President Donald Trump signed into law legislation on Monday nicknamed the Take It Down Act, which requires platforms to remove nonconsensual instances of “intimate visual depiction” within 48 hours of receiving a request. Companies that take longer or don’t comply at all could be subject to penalties of roughly $50,000 per violation.The law received support from tech firms like Google, Meta, and Microsoft and will go into effect within the next year. Enforcement will be left up to the Federal Trade Commission, which has the power to penalize companies for what it deems unfair and deceptive business practices. Other countries, including India, have enacted similar regulations requiring swift removals of sexually explicit photos or deepfakes. Delays can lead to content spreading uncontrollably across the web; Microsoft, for example, took months to act in one high-profile case.But free speech advocates are concerned that a lack of guardrails in the Take It Down Act could allow bad actors to weaponize the policy to force tech companies to unjustly censor online content. The new law is modeled on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which requires internet service providers to expeditiously remove material that someone claims is infringing on their copyright. Companies can be held financially liable for ignoring valid requests, which has motivated many firms to err on the side of caution and preemptively remove content before a copyright dispute has been resolved.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full story.",

      "postText": "The courts have decided against DOGE and the US government in their legal battle to take full control of the United States Institute of Peace, including a headquarters building with an estimated value of $500 million.In a memorandum opinion, US district court judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of the former institute board and staff who had sued to be reinstalled at the agency after DOGE affiliates forcibly removed them in March. She also gave a strong rebuke to the defendants in the case, who include the US DOGE Service, President Donald Trump, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, and several other government representatives and agencies.“The purported removal of members of the Board of Directors of the United States Institute of Peace (“USIP”) … was unlawful,” Howell wrote in the order, “and therefore null, void, and without legal effect.”The order states that the USIP board members who had been forced out must be reinstated. It goes on to declare any actions taken by the agency since their removal—including the headquarters transfer—null and void. It further bars the defendants from “maintaining, retaining, gaining, or exercising any access or control over the Institute’s offices, facilities, computer systems, or any other records, files, or resources.”The ruling caps off one of the most dramatic chapters in DOGE’s government takeover so far. It’s also one of the fullest repudiations yet of DOGE overreach.Tap the 🔗 in bio to read the full story.",
