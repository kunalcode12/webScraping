Researchers used two sets of observations taken 11 years apart to trace the motions of NGC 346‚Äôs stars, revealing them to be spiraling in toward the center of the cluster. This spiraling motion arises from a stream of gas from outside of the cluster that fuels star formation in the center of the turbulent cloud.‚Äâ‚ÄâImage description: A star cluster within a nebula.

Observations show that auroras on Jupiter are huge in size and are also hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on Earth. On Earth, auroras are caused by solar storms. When charged particles rain down on the upper atmosphere, it excites gases and causes them to glow colors of red, green, and purple. On Jupiter, there's an additional source of auroras ‚Äî the magnetic field of the gas giant grabs charged particles from its surroundings, including its tumultuous volcanic moon, Io.Io‚Äôs estimated 400 volcanoes spew particles that escape the moon‚Äôs gravity and orbit Jupiter. During a solar storm, a barrage of charged particles is unleashed onto the planet. Jupiter‚Äôs large and powerful magnetic field captures charged particles and accelerates them to tremendous speeds. These speedy particles slam into the planet‚Äôs atmosphere at high energies, which excites the gas and causes it to glow. Now, Webb‚Äôs unique capabilities are providing new insights into the auroras on Jupiter. The telescope‚Äôs sensitivity allows astronomers to increase the shutter speed to capture the quick changes of auroral features. Visual descriptions:1.

Our Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) was able to detect the magnetic field streamlines shown over this image. Eta Carinae, a huge active star neighboring the Keyhole Nebula, could have influenced the nebula's shape with its strong winds. Data from SOFIA's observations show that the magnetic fields in the loop seem affected by the star's strong wing. The magnetic field spreads out in a fan shape, matching the wind from Eta Carinae. This shows that the magnetic field is being disturbed by the star's energy. The magnetic field in the loop is much weaker than the star's wind, which means that while magnetic fields are important in the early stages of star formation, they don‚Äôt do much to stop the cloud from being broken apart by the energy from massive stars. Scientists now wonder if the same is true in other places where big stars are forming. Image description: The Keyhole Nebula glows in shades of blue, pink and purple.

The Cigar Galaxy, located 12 million light-years from Earth, gets its name from its thin, cigar-like appearance. The Cigar Galaxy is actually a spiral galaxy, like our own Milky Way‚Äîwe're just seeing it on its side. Gravitational forces from its galactic neighbor (known as M81, or Messier 81) are resonating through the Cigar Galaxy, causing stars to form at an extraordinarily high rate. Eventually, though, the Cigar Galaxy will burn itself out: when it runs out of new material to make stars, likely in tens of millions of years, the starburst will subside.This image of the Cigar Galaxy was unveiled by our @NASAHubble telescope team in 2006. The red in the image represents hydrogen and infrared light, indicating starburst activity. The blue and greenish-yellow colors are visible wavelengths of light.

The image itself was the final work of one of @NASAHubble's instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). First installed in 1993, the WFPC2 was replaced in 2009 by the Wide Field Camera 3 during Hubble‚Äôs final servicing mission.The swirling, paint-like clouds in the darkness of space are clouds of ionized atoms thrown into space by a dying star. Its red giant star had exhausted its available fuel and shed its last layers of gas, enabling nuclear fusion as its compact core begins to contract further. The exposed core reaches extremely hot temperatures, radiating ultraviolet light that energizes the enormous clouds of gas cast off by the star. In this image, red and orange indicate nitrogen, green is hydrogen, and blue shows oxygen. The spectacle is bittersweet, as the brief phase of fusion in the core will end after only tens of thousands of years, leaving a white dwarf that will never illuminate the clouds around it again.Image description: A glowing, jagged ring encircles a small central region of greenish clouds, making it appear like a hole torn in fabric.

It's a beacon for amateur treasure hunters‚Äîcalled mudlarks‚Äîwho regularly search the Thames' riverbank for recently unearthed artifacts. The river's silt blocks oxygen from reaching buried treasures, preventing metal from rusting, while the tides expose new artifacts daily. But a recent surge in popularity‚Äîthanks to viral influencers‚Äîhas forced the Port of London Authority to cap the number of permits it offers mudlarks, impacting both the hobbyists and the treasures they seek.Pictured above are some of the treasures discovered in the River Thames: 18th-century dentures made from human teeth, a Roman marble head (probably of a goddess), a ball and chain from the late 1600s, and glasses from around 1600 CE.Learn more about mudlarking and see what these enthusiasts have unearthed at the link in bio.Photographs by @simoncroberts",

Photo 1: The swarm moves into an old black woodpecker nest cavity (viewed from inside to outside). Photo 2: A construction bee uses its mandibles to take wax scales from a nestmate. Photo 3: About two weeks after the bees move in, the first combs become visible.Honeybees are important pollinators, helping a large variety of plants reproduce and improving harvests., Fruit and vegetable plants in particular depend on honeybee pollination. Some pesticides used in agriculture can be highly toxic to honeybees. Neurotoxins from the neonicotinoid group are particularly devastating. Theys disrupt the bees' sense of orientation and memory and weaken their immune systems. As a result, bees can no longer find their way back to their hive and become vulnerable to disease. #WorldBeeDayThe pictures are part of my story, \"The Secrets of Bees,\" published in the March 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.
